      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am just your ordinary passerby, a beginner programmer who strive to be a developer.</p><br>
      <h5>As a Sagittarians</h5>
        <p>I am full of curiousity, a free-spirit, an open-minded and blunt person. I get bored easily and always searching for something interesting, novel and creative. Though I am not a detail-oriented, but I often unconciously find unnoticable things. I am always longing for traveling and meeting new people. My solaces are looking at the pastel-coloured or night sky, town-watching, rain and greeneries. A unique taste of mine is something classic and a mixed from that, like Chinoiserie and Lindsey Stirling's music.</p><br>
        <h5>As an Introvert</h5>
        <p>I am comfortable with myself, independent, and more often than not, seeing things in third person's perspective. For me, public speaking in front of hundreds or thousands is less stressful than having to mingle with tens/'' of those people afterwards. While mingling with new people is still fun, keeping in touch often is cumbersome. Historically, if I remember it right, I owned smartphone only when I was on my third year in college.</p>
